Structure

  [org.apache.maven.doxia.eclipse.dependencies] builds an OSGi bundle with all of the dependencies
  that are not OSGi in their native form. Due to a Tycho limitation, you have to run mvn install
  on this before building the <<<eclipse>>> subdirectory.

  [eclipse] contains all of the other material, using Tycho to make eclipse plugins.
