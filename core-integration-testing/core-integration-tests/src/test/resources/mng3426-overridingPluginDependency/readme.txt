There is another test under MNG-2972 that also reproduces this without external dependencies. The test contained here relies on castor. There is one other subtle difference in these tests: 3426 calls a plugin directly while 2972 has it bound to the lifecycle. We found at least one instance where 2972 passes and 3426 fails. Therefore, we should keep both tests as they execute different functionality.
