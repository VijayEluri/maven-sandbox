Maven Wagon API

 The Wagon API project defines a simple API for transfering resources
 (artifacts) to and from repositories. The word repository is used in this context as
 it is commonly used in
 {{{http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/reference/glossary.html}Maven}}
 And means a storage of artifacts.

 It is also used to deploy the Maven generated site to a server.

 Maven Wagon API defines the contract between different Wagon implementations
